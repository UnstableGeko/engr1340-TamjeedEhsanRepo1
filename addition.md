\#Addition of 2 integers.

Addition is the sum of two numbers
Example:
3 + 5 = 8

Step:
Start at 3 and move 5 steps forward → 8



Example 2:

-4 + 6 = 2



If signs differ:

Subtract 4 from 6 → 2

Keep the sign of the larger absolute value (6 is positive)


Multiplication works by imagining groups of things so ab would be "a groups of b things." Then you take the total amout of items. 4\*3=12
